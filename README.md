### Overview
 <hr>

 

 
The Tech Ward website is a comparable online discussion platform to HackerNews. The website allows users to participate in technological discussions. A user can register, make new posts, react to other threads, and rate the threads made by others. A guest (un-registered) user may just read the threads. The user will be able to filter the threads depending on various search filters such as programming, gadgets, machine learning, and so on.
